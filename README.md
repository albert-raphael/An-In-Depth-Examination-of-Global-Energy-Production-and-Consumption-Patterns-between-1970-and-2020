#### Project Introduction
This project aims to explore energy consumption trends and patterns over time using world energy consumption data. The project aims to answer the following essential questions:

- What is the aggregate energy production and consumption of various sources such as coal, gas, oil, solar, and wind?
- How has the global energy consumption trend evolved from 1970 to 2020?
- Which countries have seen a significant increase or decrease in energy consumption over time?
- What are the average disparities in energy consumption patterns between developed and developing nations?
- How have the disparities in energy consumption patterns between developed and developing nations changed over time?
- How have the average disparities in energy production patterns between developed and developing nations changed over time?
- Is there a correlation between a country's GDP and its energy consumption?
- Is there a correlation between a country's GDP and its energy production?

To answer these questions, various graphs and charts will be used to visualize the trends and patterns observed in the world energy analysis.

#### About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, an online platform providing open datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption). Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/energy) maintains this dataset. The dataset is updated regularly and includes data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix, and other relevant metrics. With over 10700 entries, this dataset is useful for data analysts and businesses willing to explore trends and patterns in their energy data.

#### Significance of Analyzing World Energy Trends
Understanding energy consumption patterns and trends is vital for identifying future energy demands, forecasting, and developing effective energy policies. This is particularly important for companies that operate in the energy market. Analyzing energy consumption patterns provides valuable insights into the market, enabling companies to develop and market products that meet the needs of their customers. By creating solutions that help reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint, these companies can contribute to creating a sustainable future.

To perform this analysis, Python and the Pandas library will be used. These provide powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. Additionally, Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used for data visualization to provide in-depth insights and a comprehensive understanding of world energy consumption patterns.
